## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

Given that most of the reviews are negative, the producer of this coconut water should improve the quality of their product, addressing the complaints about the taste and texture. They could run tests of the revised product on a focus group and do in-store samples. They could explore how ingredients may have changed over time to cause these reviews.
